//! swym uses 3 different types of epochs to perform synchronization: EpochClock,
//! ThreadEpoch, and EpochLock. The common language between these three types, is the unsychronized
//! QuiesceEpoch. Below is a rough explanation of how these three synchronization types interact.
//!
//! - The EpochClock is a singleton, which holds the current "time".
//! - Each transactional memory location contains an EpochLock which holds the "time" at which the
//!   memory location was last written if unlocked. If locked, the location is currently being
//!   modified.
//! - Each thread holds a ThreadEpoch which contains the "time" that the thread is currently reading
//!   from or a sentinel "INACTIVE_EPOCH", if the thread isn't doing anything transactional.
//!
//! These three types interact as follows.
//! - An inactive thread reads the current "time" from the EpochClock and stores it in its
//!   ThreadEpoch - pinning the thread.
//! - It then proceeds to read from transactional memory locations and check the EpochLock's "time"
//!   to ensure that the value is not locked, and was written before the thread was pinned.
//! - In order to write to one or more locations
//!     - the thread acquires the locations EpochLock(s)
//!     - writes the new values
//!     - bumps current time on the EpochClock
//!     - the thread then atomically unlocks the locations EpochLocks, and sets their new modified
//!       time to the bumped EpochClock time.
//!
//! ThreadEpoch also plays a role in garbage collection. That is more thoroughly explained in
//! `internal/gc.rs`
